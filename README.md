## Usage

The original mass spectrometry data in the manuscript were analyzed by SHIMADZU's Imaging MS Solution Ver.1.30, and the data types included the following:

- **Optical diagram (bmp file)** 
- **Mass Spectrometry Data (kbd file)** 
- **ROI Analysis data (imd file)** 


These datasets contain pre-processing and visualization of raw MS data. With Imaging MS solutions, you can open the following data:
- Various numbers and intensities of mass spectra were observed in the m/z range of 500-3000 across the brain section. Data: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1D_0PJakrLnSs9VFDNEF7ow (pass word:5555)
