## Usage

The original mass spectrometry data in the manuscript were analyzed by SHIMADZU's Imaging MS Solution Ver.1.30, and the data types included the following:
**Call PubTator:**
**Optical diagram (bmp file)** 
**Mass Spectrometry Data (kbd file)** 
**ROI Analysis data (imd file)** 


These datasets contain pre-processing and visualization of raw MS data. With Imaging MS solutions, you can open the following data:
